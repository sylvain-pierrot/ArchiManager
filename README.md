## Introduction

ArchiManager is an application for architects that facilitates the management of projects and clients thanks to its simplicity and intuitiveness:

1.  The application allows the architect to log in and view all his existing projects and clients, as well as create new projects and clients as needed. Clients can be individuals or legal entities.

2.  The application provides quick and easy access to key project and client information, as well as summaries and statistics, allowing the architect to make informed decisions in real time. For example, each project is associated to one or more parcels. The application allows the architect to view the details of each parcel.

3.  For each project, the application allows the architect to define phases which are the stages of the project. Each phase can be associated with different tasks, which can be performed either by the architect himself or by external service providers.

4.  The application also allows the architect to create tags to categorize his projects and to assign them a status (in progress or completed). This allows to follow the progress of the projects in a clear and organized way.

5.  Finally, the application offers a document area for each project, where the architect can store files related to the project, such as plans, estimates, invoices, etc. The application also allows to generate documents from the known data.
